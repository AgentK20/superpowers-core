Superpowers is a downloadable HTML5 app. You can use it solo like a regular offline game maker,
or setup a password and let friends join in on your project through their Web browser.
It's great for working together over long periods of time, for jamming over a weekend,
or just for helping each other out with debugging!

We've built the [Superpowers Game engine](https://github.com/superpowers/superpowers-game) and a bunch of asset editors for it.
But the coolest thing is this: Superpowers itself is actually engine-agnostic.
It's just a piece of software for collaborating on projects and you can add project types and editors to it.
